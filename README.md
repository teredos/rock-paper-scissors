# Rock Paper Scissors

This is my [Rock Paper Scissors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors) project, written in JavaScript, as assigned by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com). This version of the game is played via the browser console. You play 5 rounds against your opponent, the computer, and the player with the most points at the end of the 5th round wins!
